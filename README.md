# IR_TOUCH_SENSOR

Developed an IR-touch sensor using an 8051 microcontroller, an IR LED, and a photodetector. The sensor shines infrared light across a surface using the LED. Photodetector on the other side picks up this light. When you touch the surface, you block some of the light, and the photodetector notices the change. Microcontroller can then figure out exactly where you touched based on the pattern of interrupted light beams. This lets the sensor pinpoint your touch location!
